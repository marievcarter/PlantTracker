# Plant Tracker

A site for managing your plants. Here you can keep track of plants and their care instructions, create recurring calendar events for tasks like watering, and identify unknown plants with the plant identifier page.

## Working Features

Add new plants.

Set a last watered, last feeding and last repot date.

### TODO

Create a separate notifications bar at the top of dashboard component.

Bring in charts (possibly recharts) to show general trends such as weekly
watering per plant, etc on the dashboard.

Restructure files so that components are all exported into a single file where
other files can then import from.

Make sure every plant has a picture loading properly.
