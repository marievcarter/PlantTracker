# Plant Tracker

A site for managing my plants. Currently only tracks my personal plants, but will eventually be extended to support multiple users., and

Add new plants, information such as care instruction, and recurring calendar events for watering, repotting, and fertilizer.

A plant indentification page is in the works.

## Working Features

Add new plants.

Set a last watered, last feeding and last repot date.

### TODO

Create a separate notifications bar at the top of dashboard component.

Bring in charts (possibly recharts) to show general trends such as weekly
watering per plant, etc on the dashboard.

Restructure files so that components are all exported into a single file where
other files can then import from.

Make sure every plant has a picture loading properly.
